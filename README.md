# RL_algorithms_Pytorch
This repo is to implement some typical reinforcement learning algorithms in Pytorch.

Algorithms:
- DQN
- Dueling DQN
- Dueling Double DQN
- Policy Gradient
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)   
    including continuous and discrete action space
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Actor Critic 
    including continuous and discrete action space
- Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)
- Soft Actor Critic (SAC)
